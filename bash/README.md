# Bash

My configuration files for the [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell.

## Installation

* Copy all the files to `$HOME/`.
* If you want to use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and my configuration for it, here is what you need to do:
    * Install it by following [these instructions](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), including key bindings and completion. My configuration expects the key bindings and completion to be in the `$HOME/.fzf` directory.
    * Install the following optional dependencies:
        * [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for syntax highlighting in the preview window.
        * [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for faster listing of files and directories.
